# mooncore

This is the central service of my smarthome app. It's based on
[Loopback 4](http://loopback.io) and written in TypeScript.

## Services

There are several services for lighting, based on the lighting's purpose.
Lights intended to illuminate a room are set using the `Illumination` service,
animated decorative lights are set using the `Animation` service. Other
lighting purposes will be handled by future services.

### Illumination

This service sets the lighting intended for illuminating a room.
